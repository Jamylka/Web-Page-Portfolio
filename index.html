                        <p>I am 24 years old living in Chicago, IL. I was born in Yonkers, NY, and then raised in Ocala, FL. I went to UCF in Orlando, FL to study Psychology. I have been working as a Flight Attendant since 2017 and have loved every minute
                            of it. I like to describe myself as a people person who enjoys staying at home. I love to socialize and get to know new people, you never know what someone else can teach you or what impact you can have on another person. I
                            value the things each individual can bring to the table. I believe this world would be a much better place if we all just work together.</p>

                        <p>I have always wanted to join the technology industry. I created a Codecademy account and haven't stopped practicing to code since this was in April of 2020. I am so excited to use my new skill and be a positive addition to so many
                            companies. I have always been the kind of person that can excel in working alone but also loves to work with others. When you have someone else to work with, there are more ideas, better solutions, and overall better work environment,
                            and someone who can hold you accountable. Aside from web development, I do enjoy learning about nutrition and mental health. I enjoy reading self-help books and learning about myself on a deeper level. I am always searching
                            for the next adventure.</p>
